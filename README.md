# Dashless Dream Blocks - Celeste Mod
A code mod for the [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/) mod loader for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/).

Adds the toggleable ability to "dash" through DreamBlocks when the player has no dashes available.

This can be enabled globally through the Everest `Mod Options` menu, or for a particular map with the `DashlessDreaming` and `DashlessDreaming (No Backpack)` Inventory.

Report bugs to `@coloursofnoise` on the [Celeste Discord](discord.gg/celeste) or by opening an issue on [Github](https://github.com/coloursofnoise/DashlessDreamBlocks/issues).
