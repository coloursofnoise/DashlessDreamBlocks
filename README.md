# Dashless Dream Blocks - Celeste Mod
A code mod for the [Everest](https://everestapi.github.io/) mod loader for [Celeste](http://www.celestegame.com/).

Adds the toggleable ability to "dash" through DreamBlocks when the player has no dashes available.

This can be enabled globally through the Everest `Mod Options` menu, or for a particular map with the `DashlessDreaming` and `DashlessDreaming (No Backpack)` Inventory.

To include this mod in your map, add the following to the `Dependencies` section of your [everest.yaml](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Mod-Structure#using-helper-mods):
```yaml
    - Name: DashlessDreamBlocks
      Version: 2.0.1
```
